 <h2 class="pageID">responsive website v.s. mobile app research</h2> <p>Responsive vs Mobile
       Well responsive websites uses HTML codes and it is easy to access it from any browser. Nonetheless, although most of the websites are designed to be viewed on desktop, basically, mobile website is designed to work on small screens like tablets and cell phones. If you think about it, those are two very essential, related, but still a bit different things.
       Responsive website uses particular layout using CSS media queries. CSS media queries helps website content to be viewed in any type of screen like 19’ Macintosh or 3’ cell phone. Queries may depend upon more developer’s work and attention, also those websites will likely download slower..
       Most of the world companies use responsive websites to make their information available. It is very compelling to have services available on different platforms and devices. This is important especially when targeting new customers. Customers most likely will start looking for information with web browsers. 
      Mobile app is a software that you can install on your smartphone or tablet. Those apps are developed for different operating systems, for example, Android, iOS, and Windows phone. Mobile apps don't run on all the devices, they need to be installed independently, however, you will have a unique user experience. Website are designed to target new or infrequent customers, where the mobile app works with everyday customer.
      Mobile app are very useful when a client wants to accomplish a personal goal. Most of the apps are designed to help the client accomplish his/her goal with less taps. On the other hand, if you need to create different apps for several operating systems your cost will be much higher. 
       To such a degree, they both have their pros and cons. It’s hard to say one is better than the other, you must study both alternatives to decide which one is right for your company. Finally, you need to understand the objective of your brand, which client will use it and for what purpose.
